# Solus

A homepage that cares: Solus asks how your day is going, and tries to complement your mood with images and colour. 

# Uses the Web Speech API

Solus uses modern computer (and mobile) browsers' access to microphone and speakers to talk to its user. It takes in the results and compares them to gramar sets about mood to set the background.

# Future Roadmap

In the future, Solus would like to:

* talk back to the user to refine understanding
* open with each new tab
* play music
* pull the user's itunes music and create a mood-based station
* subtly change colours with the time of day
* remember/learn about an individual over time
* have longer, more meaningful conversations
* offer additional widgets such as weather
* have a user panel to refine voice style, et al.
